A SELF - REMINDER ON REPLICATION

Replication is important. The project structure here aims to provide two methods of environment creation for two
different package managers: conda and pip.

Conda environment creation works with environment.yml files. To create an environment.yml file, run the following
command in an Anaconda interpreter before loading it all into GitHub:

conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml

The resulting environment.yml file will include ONLY the packages you have explicitly installed using the conda
package manager. These packages will then download their own dependencies. This will effectively create a cross-
platform environment creation script.

Some packages cannot be installed using only conda package manager. After the file is created,
be sure to include the following under the "DEPENDENCIES:" tag:

-pip
-pip:
   - PIP PACKAGE_1
   - PIP PACKAGE_2

We also have to account for pip-only installations. For that, do the following in an Python interpreter:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

These two files are the bare minimum for the reproducibility of our analysis environment.

After you are done with extracting the environment, you should create a dodo.py file to use with the doit module.
You should implement a DAG structure in the dodo.py file for two reasons:
	- You can run your own analysis with a single command, without running the parts that are already done.
	- The person trying to replicate the analysis can do so with a single command.
